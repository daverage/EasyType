# Add EasyType Sans, EasyType Focus, EasyType Dyslexic

**Font Project Git Repo URL:**  
https://github.com/daverage/EasyType

**Super short description of the Font Family:**  
Trio of neuro-inclusive sans serif families (EasyType Sans, Focus, Dyslexic) built from Google’s Noto sources with anchoring, spacing, and rhythm adjustments to keep long-form reading calm for ADHD/dyslexic readers.

**Requirements:**  
By opening this issue, I confirm the project meets the following requirements:

- [x] I am the sole copyright author of the entire project, or, all other copyright authors have licensed their work to me under the OFL
- [x] There are no "Reserved Font Names" in the OFL license information, or in the project documentation of any known upstream projects. If there are RFNs, they are not used in whole or in part in this family name, or, I want to discuss how Google can work with my use of them.
- [x] The family name is unique according to [namecheck.fontdata.com](https://namecheck.fontdata.com/)

- [x] The repo has the [Google Fonts preferred upstream repo structure](https://googlefonts.github.io/gf-guide/upstream.html)
- [x] I have read, agree with, and comply with, the full [Google Fonts contributing requirements](https://googlefonts.github.io/gf-guide/index#pre-production-getting-your-fonts-ready-for-gf)
- [x] I will maintain the repository and participate in the onboarding process (addressing, solving, and responding to issues, merging pull requests, etc)

<p><a href="https://marczewski.me.uk/easytype">EasyType Dyslexic</a> is part of the neuro-inclusive EasyType suite. EasyType Dyslexic maximizes openness, with sculpted apertures, wider bowls, and generous weights that keep each glyph distinct even when the eyes tire. Every release ships with Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic so typographic systems can stay cohesive while respecting different reading needs.</p>
<p>Designed and documented by Andrzej Marczewski, the EasyType builder script and QA notes live in the GitHub repository so every change is reproducible. To contribute or explore the tooling, visit <a href="https://github.com/daverage/EasyType">github.com/daverage/EasyType</a>.</p>

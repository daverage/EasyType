<p><a href="https://marczewski.me.uk/easytype">EasyType Sans</a> is part of the neuro-inclusive EasyType suite. EasyType Sans is the balanced workhorse of the trio, tuned for interfaces, editorial work, and educational layouts. It keeps the familiar Noto proportions but adds optical anchoring and a raised x-height so every word starts from a consistent visual landmark. Every release ships with Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic so typographic systems can stay cohesive while respecting different reading needs.</p>
<p>Designed and documented by Andrzej Marczewski, the EasyType builder script and QA notes live in the GitHub repository so every change is reproducible. To contribute or explore the tooling, visit <a href="https://github.com/daverage/EasyType">github.com/daverage/EasyType</a>.</p>

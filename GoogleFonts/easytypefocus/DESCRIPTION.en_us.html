<p><a href="https://marczewski.me.uk/easytype">EasyType Focus</a> is part of the neuro-inclusive EasyType suite. EasyType Focus is engineered for focused reading: each letter and word spacing is looser, the counters breathe easier, and the gentle micro-spacing keeps lines composed even when attention drifts. Every release ships with Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic so typographic systems can stay cohesive while respecting different reading needs.</p>
<p>Designed and documented by Andrzej Marczewski, the EasyType builder script and QA notes live in the GitHub repository so every change is reproducible. To contribute or explore the tooling, visit <a href="https://github.com/daverage/EasyType">github.com/daverage/EasyType</a>.</p>

<p><span class="autonym">EasyType</span> is a family of neuro-inclusive sans serif styles that pair anchoring, spacing, and rhythm cues so that long-form text feels easier to follow for readers living with attention or decoding challenges. The design brief prioritized calmer saccadic rhythm and subtle optical cues so that each word begins with a consistent visual landmark, every line maintains a comfortable column width, and the whole set keeps a bright yet grounded color so reading stays smooth from first page to last. Because the project started as a personal experiment for less noisy reading, the vocabulary in this article stays practical and focused on comfort.

<p>The glyphs are built on Google’s Noto sources but every step adds EasyType’s layers: entry anchoring, a raised x-height, and graduated micro spacing to reduce crowding without compromising neutral proportions. For Latin, Latin Extended, Greek, and Cyrillic, the builder applies the same spacing harmonies so multilingual content keeps the same calm momentum, and the hinting remains intact thanks to the original Noto TrueType outlines. Every change to the spacing tables, anchors, and x-height factors is tracked in the repository so the same adjustments can be reproduced or tuned for future scripts. Spacing, anchors, and micro-adjustments are scripted in Python with fontTools, and automated tests against Fontbakery and in-browser specimens ensure that the optical rhythm holds across sizes and rendering environments.</p>

<p>Inside the suite, EasyType Sans is the neutral everyday workhorse, tuned for interfaces, editorial blocks, and educational material. EasyType Focus introduces broader word and letter spacing, giving each word room to breathe and helping slower readers keep track of the next fixation. EasyType Dyslexic increases openness even further, with sculpted apertures, uncluttered counters, and generous weights that keep characters distinct when the eyes are tired. Every family ships with Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic so typographic systems can stay cohesive while respecting different reading needs, and the shared metrics file keeps ascender-to-descender ratios consistent across the trio.</p>

<p>Quality assurance is baked into the repository: the builder script replicates the same pipeline that produced the published releases, and Fontbakery reports plus specimen proofs live alongside the generated files. Compressed webfonts are included for previewing the fonts in HTML specimens, and any future regression only requires rerunning `python3 font.py` followed by the contained `build.sh` helper. The README and article double as documentation for the gftools packager so onboarding the EasyType families into google/fonts can reuse the same text, and when a new language or axis is added the repo documents the steps so the workflow stays reproducible.</p>

<p>EasyType is released under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 so it can be embedded, bundled, and modified freely, and this article summarizes the accessibility goals, research background, and QA approach behind the submission. Contributors, advocates, and curious readers are invited to share feedback or extensions through the GitHub repo, where the repository also hosts promotional assets and validation reports, and the designer profile can be updated whenever new collaborators join the project.</p>

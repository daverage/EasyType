# Social assets for Google Fonts submission

This folder keeps the promotional imagery required by the Google Fonts guide. Please place the rendered specimens and poster artwork here if the collection grows.

## Expected files (suggested names)
- `poster_sm.png` – small card used for social previews (800 px wide).
- `poster_md.png` – medium cover with a tight specimen set.
- `poster_lg.png` – full-width hero image (1,200 px+).
- `specimen_48.png` – 48px specimen for low-resolution previews.
- `specimen_36.png` / `specimen_32.png` – optional additional specimens if needed.

Images should be web-optimised (JPEG or PNG, 72 dpi, <1.75 MB) and aligned with the tone described in `ARTICLE.en_us.html`.
